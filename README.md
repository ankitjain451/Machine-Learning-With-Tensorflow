# Machine-Learning-With-Tensorflow
Machine Learning Projects with Tensorflow

# Instructions for Installations 

For most of the projects I recommend using Anaconda installation of Python 3.6 for this repo.

Create a virtual environment with conda using this command:
conda create -n TensorFlowML

Activate the Virtual Environment as :
source activate TensorflowML

Each project has their own README and requirements.txt to install relevant packages. Please README of each chapter before executing the codes.Also please refer to the software list in the book for minimum required packages for each chapter.
